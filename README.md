# Marte
Control what you see on itch.io. Permanently hide specific games, remove toxic comments, filter tags, or block entire creators with a single click.

Marte is a UserScript that transforms the itch.io browsing experience into a seamless, curated stream. It replaces standard pagination with a Universal Silent Loader, fetching and stitching subsequent pages in the background without moving your viewport. Why release as a userscript? Freedom. Credit is all I ask if you happen to fork this.

## Key Features

* **Silent Infinite Load:** Automatically fetches new content on Games, Tools, Assets, and Search pages, "hydrating" lazy-loaded images instantly.
* **Granular Blocking:** Permanently hide specific games, remove toxic comments, or block entire creators with a single click.
* **Tag Filtering:** Filter out unwanted genres or themes (e.g., "Horror", "Visual Novel", "NSFW") by blocking tags directly from the UI.
* **Discreet UI:** All controls are tucked away behind a floating "Heart" toggle to keep your screen clean.
* **Data Management:** Includes a visual Manager to review hidden items and supports Markdown Import/Export to backup or share your blocklists.

## Installation

Most UserScript extensions for Chrome/Chromium will require you to manually enable **'Allow User Scripts'** in the extension's details page.

* [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
* [ScriptCat](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scriptcat/ndcooeababalnlpkfedmmbbbgkljhpjf)
* [OrangeMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/orangemonkey/ekmeppjgajofkpiofbebgcbohbmfldaf?hl=en)

**Note:** The newer [GreasePanda](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/greasepanda/aopmgjdppgdhejibmejbahdkhpklkdjf) seems to handle this automatically with the latest Chromium standards.
