# Marte
Control what you see on itch.io. Permanently hide specific games, remove toxic comments, or block entire creators with a single click and more.

Marte is a UserScript that transforms the itch.io browsing experience into a seamless, curated stream. It replaces standard pagination with a Universal Silent Loader, fetching and stitching subsequent pages in the background without moving your viewport. Why release as a userscript? Freedom. Credit is all I ask if you happen to fork this.

## Key Features:

Silent Infinite Load: Automatically fetches new content on Games, Tools, Assets, and Search pages, "hydrating" lazy-loaded images instantly.
Granular Blocking: Permanently hide specific games, remove toxic comments, or block entire creators with a single click.
Discreet UI: All controls are tucked away behind a floating "Heart" toggle to keep your screen clean.
Data Management: Includes a visual Manager to review hidden items and supports Markdown Import/Export to backup or share your blocklists.

Most UserScript extensions for chrome will require you to enable 'Allow User Scripts' manually, ([Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo), [ScriptCat](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/scriptcat/ndcooeababalnlpkfedmmbbbgkljhpjf), [OrangeMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/orangemonkey/ekmeppjgajofkpiofbebgcbohbmfldaf?hl=en)). The newer [GreasePanda](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/greasepanda/aopmgjdppgdhejibmejbahdkhpklkdjf) seems to take care of this automatically with the latest Chromium standards.
